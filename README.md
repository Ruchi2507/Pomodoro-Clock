# Pomodoro-Clock
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
## Allows user to change Session and Break Time.
## To indicate remaining time visually, a circle keeps on filling as the time progresses!
